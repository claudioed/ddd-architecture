      "1. **Entities:**\n",
      "   - **Transaction**: Represents a financial transaction with attributes like TransactionID, AccountID, Amount, Timestamp, TransactionType, and Status.\n",
      "   - **Alert**: Represents an alert generated for a transaction with attributes like AlertID, TransactionID, AlertType, Severity, Timestamp, and Status.\n",
      "   - **LogEntry**: Represents a log entry related to a transaction with attributes like LogID, TransactionID, Message, Timestamp, and LogLevel.\n",
      "   - **Investigation**: Represents an investigation triggered by an alert with attributes like InvestigationID, AlertID, InvestigatorID, Findings, Status, and Timestamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Value Objects:**\n",
      "   - **TransactionType**: Represents the type of transaction (e.g., Credit, Debit).\n",
      "   - **Severity**: Represents the severity level of an alert (e.g., Low, Medium, High).\n",
      "   - **LogLevel**: Represents the log level of a log entry (e.g., Info, Warning, Error).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Relationships:**\n",
      "   - A **Transaction** can generate multiple **Alerts**.\n",
      "   - A **Transaction** can have multiple **LogEntries**.\n",
      "   - An **Alert** can trigger an **Investigation**.\n",
      "   - An **Alert** has a **Severity** level.\n",
      "   - A **LogEntry** has a **LogLevel**.\n",
      "   - A **Transaction** has a **TransactionType**.\n",
